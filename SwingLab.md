**How SwingLab Works:**

1. **Capture:**  Record a video of your player's swing using your mobile device. 
2. **Compare:** Upload your video to SwingLab and select a professional swing from our library for side-by-side comparison.
3. **Synchronize:** Use the intuitive timeline scrubber to align the pro swing with key stages of your player's swing:
    * **Stance**
    * **Load**
    * **Launch**
    * **Turn**
    * **Contact**
    * **Extension**
    * **Follow Through**

4. **Analyze:** At each key stage, capture synchronized screenshots for detailed analysis. 
5. **Annotate:**  Use our drawing tools (arrows, lines, circles) to highlight areas for improvement and add text comments directly on the screenshots.
6. **Share:**  Instantly share annotated images with your players via email, text, or social media to reinforce coaching points and track progress.
