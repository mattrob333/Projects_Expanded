#  Symphony of Symbology: 

## A Two-Tiered Profile System for  Personalized AI Interaction and Enhanced Team Collaboration 


## FIELD

- Artificial Intelligence
- User Interface
- Human-Computer Interaction
- Team Collaboration Software
- CRM (Customer Relationship Management)

## PROBLEM 

Current AI assistants and team collaboration tools lack the nuanced understanding of individual preferences and communication styles needed for seamless, productive interaction. This leads to misunderstandings, inefficiencies, and friction in collaborative environments.

## SOLUTION 

This invention proposes a system that combines a public-facing, simplified user profile with a more detailed, private profile to guide AI interactions. The public profile, represented by a string of emojis and numbers, conveys essential information about a user's Enneagram type, communication style, emotional responsiveness, goal orientation, and adaptability. This "light" profile acts as a rubric, enabling AIs and other team members to quickly grasp a user's preferred interaction style. 

A more comprehensive private profile, accessible only to the AI assistant, houses detailed information on the user's personality traits, work preferences, communication history, and emotional intelligence. This detailed profile acts as a key, enabling the AI to interpret and respond to user requests in a highly personalized and efficient manner. 

This two-tiered system allows for nuanced and effective AI interactions while maintaining user privacy.

## ADVANTAGE 

This system offers several advantages over existing solutions:

- **Personalized AI interactions:** By leveraging both public-facing and private user profiles, the AI can tailor its communication style, emotional tone, and information delivery to individual preferences, fostering better understanding and rapport.
- **Increased team efficiency:** Improved communication and collaboration among team members through AI-mediated insights into individual working styles and preferences.
- **Reduced miscommunication and conflict:** By anticipating and adapting to individual communication styles, the AI can help mitigate misunderstandings and potential conflicts. 
- **Enhanced user privacy:** Sensitive personal information remains protected in the private profile, accessible only by the designated AI assistant. 

## NOVELTY 

While the use of user profiles for personalized experiences is common, this specific implementation demonstrates novelty in its combination of elements:

- **Emoji-based Public Profile:**  The use of a visually intuitive, universally understood emoji system to represent complex user traits in a simplified, scannable format is a novel approach. 
- **Two-Tiered Profile System:** The concept of a "light" public profile for general understanding and a detailed private profile for nuanced AI interaction, linked through a rubric and key system, appears to be a novel approach in AI-driven communication and collaboration. 

## INVENTIVE STEP

This invention demonstrates an inventive step due to its non-obvious combination of established concepts:

- **Bridging the gap between user profiles and AI interaction:** While AI assistants and personality assessments are known, using a  combined public and private profile system specifically to guide and personalize AI interaction is a non-obvious application.
- **Utilizing emojis as data representations:** While emojis are widely used, their application as a standardized system to convey complex personality and work style information to AI systems is an inventive step beyond their typical use in casual communication. 

## SUMMARY

This invention describes a system for enhancing AI interaction and team collaboration using a two-tiered user profile approach. A public-facing profile, expressed through a string of emojis and numbers, conveys key personality and work style information for general understanding. This links to a private, AI-accessible profile containing detailed user data for highly personalized and effective communication and task management.
