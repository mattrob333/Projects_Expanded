A powerful two-step workflow for generating a complete marketing and lead generation plan for your business, based on Alex Hormozi's $100M Offers and $100M Leads playbooks.

## üéØ Overview
This project provides a streamlined process for developing and implementing an effective marketing strategy for your business:

1. **$100M Offers Playbook:** Takes your business and target customer as inputs and applies Alex Hormozi's methodology to produce a fully-formed marketing plan that can be implemented immediately. 

2. **$100M Leads Playbook:** Generates a lead generation plan to attract high-quality prospects to your business.

By combining these two playbooks, you can quickly create a comprehensive marketing and outreach strategy to grow your business. The entire workflow is implemented in a multi-agent framework using Flowise, allowing you to run it via a custom chatbot interface.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### Step 1: Marketing Plan Generation
Provide basic information about your business and target customer. The $100M Offers playbook agent will then:
- Analyze your business and market
- Identify your dream customer and their key desires
- Craft an irresistible offer that perfectly matches your dream customer
- Determine the most effective marketing channels and tactics
- Generate a complete marketing plan you can begin executing on

üí° The more detail you provide about your business and customers, the more tailored and actionable the resulting marketing plan will be. Be sure to include information like your product/service, pricing, customer pain points, competitive landscape, etc.

### Step 2: Lead Generation Plan
With your core marketing plan in place, the $100M Leads playbook takes over to:
- Pinpoint your highest-value dream customers
- Uncover the online and offline watering holes where your dream customers congregate  
- Develop enticing lead magnets to attract prospects
- Determine the most effective lead generation channels for your business (e.g. Facebook ads, Google ads, organic social media, email outreach, etc.)
- Provide a full lead generation plan to fill your marketing funnel with qualified prospects

üåü Pro tip: Use customer surveys, interviews, and market research to gain a deep understanding of your dream customers. The better you understand their desires, behavior, and gathering places, the more effective your lead generation will be.

### Custom Chatbot Interface
The complete two-step workflow is implemented in a multi-agent framework using Flowise. To make it easy to use, a custom chatbot interface guides you through providing the necessary business and customer information. 

Simply chat with the bot, answer its questions, and it will output your complete marketing and lead generation battle plan, ready to put into action!
